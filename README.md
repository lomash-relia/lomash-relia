I’m currently pursuing an M.Tech in Autonomous Systems and Machine Intelligence, fueled by a deep enthusiasm for robotics, artificial intelligence, and control systems. My motivation lies in tackling challenging problems through the integration of optimization techniques and deep learning with intelligent hardware and software systems.

<h3 align="left">Professional Experience</h3>

- **Research Intern, Space Applications Center, ISRO** (Jan 2025 – Jul 2025)  
  I put together an AI-powered planetary rover on Raspberry Pi 4B with Bookworm Linux, added monocular and stereo photogrammetry for navigation, and got quantized deep learning models running smoothly on limited hardware. 

- **Student Researcher, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology** (Aug 2024 – Nov 2024)  
  I worked on predicting tropical cyclone strength from multi-spectral satellite images using neural networks, and my findings got published. 

- **Full Stack Engineer, Capitalize (Remote)** (May 2024 – Jul 2024)  
  I created Flutter apps connected to a FastAPI backend, set up automated data pipelines with Selenium, and made database operations more reliable with better error handling. 

- **AI/ML Freelancer, Upwork (Remote)** (Dec 2022 – Jun 2023)  
  I handled computer vision and NLP projects for clients around the world, and built automation tools that pulled insights from data using AI.

<h3 align="left">Key Projects</h3>

- **AI-Powered Planetary Rover**  
  I built a rover that handles both autonomous navigation and manual controls, with on-device AI for spotting objects and estimating depth in real time, all while keeping heat and power in check. 

- **Deep Learning for Cyclone Intensity Estimation**  
  I recreated cutting-edge CNN models to analyze satellite images and tested how well they performed against benchmarks. 

- **LLM-Based Knowledge Extraction System**  
  I designed a system that turns text into structured knowledge using retrieval-augmented generation with FastAPI and LangChain, and shared it at a conference. 

- **Brain Tumor Detection Mobile App**  
  I added TensorFlow Lite models to a Flutter app so users could upload medical images and get instant detection results through a clean interface.
